# employeeReact

This web applictaion used React to break up UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

When you open the app. you will get a table of random users, a table of employees rendered. 

The user will be able to:

  * Sort the table by Id, Name, location and occupation.

  * Filter the users by Color.

User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
